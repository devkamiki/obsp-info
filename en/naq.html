            <p>Some your services interest me, but there's a missing button 'registration'!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yup, apologies. The resources are so limited that it's only adequate for a single person. If you want to test with community services kindly check disroot.org and tchncs.de.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How can you guarantee the continuability? (What if you decide to quit, suddenly, or you get hit by a bus?)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I can't.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Will my data remain private?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technically you can read the docs of these OSS projects to evaluate the maximum rights admin would gain.</li>
                <li>For Vaultwarden exclusively, we can't see your secrets, but we can delete them. Keep it in mind and backup constantly!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where are you based?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Admin is in NL. Servers are in DE.</li>
