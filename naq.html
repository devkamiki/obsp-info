    <h1>NAQ-Never Asked Questions</h1>
    <li>I viewed all your services but there's a missing button 'registration'!</li>
      <li>Yup, apoligies.The resources are so limited that it's only adequate for a single person.</li>
    <li>Your domain sucks. Get a better one!</li>
      <li>I wish I could, but memorable and cheap domains just aren't there anymore:)</li>
    <li> Why are you using codeberg pages instead of github/gitlab/gitea/...?</li>
      <li>You may not believe that, but I like codeberg's ui. Feel free to criticize me:)</li>
